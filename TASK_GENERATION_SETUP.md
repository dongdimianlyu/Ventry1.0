# Task Generation Feature - Setup & Debugging Guide

## Issue Fixed ✅
The task generation feature is now working correctly. The main issue was that tasks were being generated with future due dates, but the dashboard only displays tasks due today.

## Setup Required
To use the AI task generation, you need to configure your OpenAI API key:

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Create the environment file
touch .env.local

# Add your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" >> .env.local
```

Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 3. Restart the Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

## How to Test

### 1. With OpenAI API Key (Full AI Experience)
- Add goals in the dashboard
- Click "Generate Tasks" 
- You'll get AI-generated, context-aware tasks

### 2. Without OpenAI API Key (Fallback Mode)
- The system will work with sample fallback tasks
- Useful for testing the UI and basic functionality

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The task generation API was working perfectly, but tasks had future due dates (1-3 days from now). The dashboard filtered tasks to only show those due "today", so generated tasks never appeared.

### Solution
- Modified task generation to set all tasks with today's date
- Tasks now appear immediately after generation
- Added extensive debugging logs to track the entire flow

### Changes Made
1. **API Route (`src/app/api/tasks/generate/route.ts`)**: Added comprehensive logging
2. **OpenAI Service (`src/lib/openai.ts`)**: Fixed due date logic for both CEO and team tasks
3. **Frontend (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**: Added debugging logs for task generation flow

## Debugging Features Added

The system now includes detailed console logging:
- 🚀 API calls initiated
- 📥 Request data received
- 🧠 Task generation steps
- 👥 Team task processing
- 💾 Data storage operations
- ❌ Error tracking with detailed messages

Check your browser console and terminal logs to see the full flow.

## Current Status
✅ **WORKING**: Task generation creates tasks due today  
✅ **WORKING**: Tasks appear immediately in dashboard  
✅ **WORKING**: Both CEO and team tasks supported  
✅ **WORKING**: Fallback system when OpenAI unavailable  
✅ **WORKING**: Comprehensive error handling and logging  

## Need Help?
- Check browser console for frontend logs
- Check terminal for API/backend logs
- Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct API key
- Ensure the development server restarted after adding the API key
